## Project Overview
The NYC Vehicle Collision Analysis project utilizes historical traffic and weather data to forecast vehicle collision occurrences across different boroughs of New York City. This initiative aims to enhance urban safety by identifying high-risk periods and areas, enabling targeted interventions.

## Objectives
- **Collision Prediction:** Develop predictive models to forecast collision events, incorporating factors like weather conditions, time of day, and geographic specifics.
- **Causative Analysis:** Identify and analyze factors that significantly contribute to collision rates, aiming to inform safety improvements and policy adjustments.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Leverage predictive insights to guide urban planning and traffic management strategies, ultimately reducing collision rates and enhancing road safety.

## Methodologies
- **Data Preparation and Cleaning:** Employed preprocessing techniques to clean and balance the dataset, ensuring robust model training and analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted thorough exploratory analysis to understand underlying patterns and trends in collision data across boroughs and under different environmental conditions.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilized Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) for their robustness in handling complex, non-linear data relationships, optimizing the model to predict collisions effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **Big Data Tools:** PySpark for data processing and model training, leveraging Spark's distributed computing capabilities to manage large-scale data efficiently.
- **Machine Learning:** Applied advanced machine learning techniques, focusing on ensemble methods like Gradient Boosted Trees to capture the nuanced dynamics of collision occurrences.
- **Data Visualization:** Used Power BI to create interactive dashboards that visually represent trends, predictions, and insights, facilitating easy comprehension and decision-making.

## Key Achievements
- **Model Performance:** Achieved significant predictive accuracy, with the models indicating strong performance in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Insight Generation:** Identified critical time slots and conditions with higher risks of collisions, particularly noting the counterintuitive increase in accidents during clear weather conditions.
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Provided data-backed recommendations for traffic management and safety enhancements, particularly in boroughs with higher collision frequencies.

## Future Directions
- **Model Enhancement:** Plan to integrate additional data sources and explore more sophisticated machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Aim to develop a real-time predictive system that can dynamically adjust to ongoing traffic and weather conditions, providing live insights to city planners and traffic controllers.
- **Extended Impact:** Explore applications of the model's insights beyond traffic management, such as in emergency response optimization and urban design improvements.
